# Adobe Experience Platform Launch{#adobe-launch}

Media Analytics (Heartbeats) es la soluciÃ³n de seguimiento de medios estandarizada de Adobe. Ha reemplazado el modelo anterior de Milestone de Adobe.

Adobe Experience Platform Launch, the follow-on product to Dynamic Tag Management, features a Launch extension that facilitates implementing tracking in your media players.

You can learn more about the Launch extension here: [Adobe Media Analytics for Audio and Video Extension](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/extension-reference/web/adobe-media-analytics-for-audio-and-video-extension)

>[!NOTE]
>
>For this implementation path, customers need to contact their Sales Representative/Account Manager to sign a new Sales Order as Media Analytics has a unique SKU and changes from a pricing model based on server calls to a model based on media streams.
